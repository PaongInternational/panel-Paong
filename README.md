üì¶ Installation Prerequisites
Ensure your host system (Termux, Debian, Ubuntu, or any VPS) has the following core components installed:
 * Git
 * Node.js (LTS version is highly recommended for the panel's stability)
 * PM2 (Essential global process manager)
üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Installation Guide (Termux/Linux)
Follow these steps to successfully install and run your Panel Paong instance using PM2.
Step 1: Install System Dependencies
# Update and upgrade system packages (Termux/Linux)
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y 

# Install Git and Node.js
pkg install git nodejs -y 

# (Optional) Install Python if you plan to run Python bots
# pkg install python -y 

# Install PM2 globally (Crucial for persistence)
npm install pm2 -g

Step 2: Clone Repository and Install Panel Modules
# Navigate to your desired installation directory
cd $HOME 

# Clone the project from GitHub
git clone [https://github.com/PaongInternational/panel-Paong.git](https://github.com/PaongInternational/panel-Paong.git)

# Enter the project directory
cd panel-Paong

# Install Node.js modules required by Panel Paong (Express, Socket.IO, etc.)
npm install

Step 3: Run the Panel Server with PM2
Using PM2 ensures the panel runs persistently in the background and automatically restarts upon failure or system reboot.
# Start the Panel Paong server on the default port (3000)
pm2 start index.js --name "Paong-Panel"

# Save the PM2 configuration to ensure the panel automatically restarts on system reboot
pm2 save

# Check the status (Verify "Paong-Panel" shows 'online')
pm2 status

Step 4: Access the Web Panel
The panel will be accessible on Port 3000.
| Access Type | URL Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Local Access (Termux/Internal) | http://127.0.0.1:3000 | Access from the same machine. |
| External Access (VPS/Remote) | http://[YOUR_SERVER_IP]:3000 | You must ensure Port 3000 is open in your server's firewall (e.g., ufw allow 3000). |
